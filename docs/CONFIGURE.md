# Config

**Use `hyprshell config edit` to open the hyprshell config editor. It also contains documentation of all the options.**

---

The main config file is located at `~/.config/hyprshell/config.ron` but can be configured using the `-c` argument. You can also use `.toml` and `.json(5)` as config file formats.
The config is loaded at startup and is reloaded when the file changes.

To interactively generate a default config file with all possible options set, run the following command:

```bash
hyprshell config generate
```

In case this documentation is outdated, or you understand rust, look at the [struct definition](../crates/config-lib/src/structs.rs) for the most up-to-date information.

The default values for these configs, which are also the values that get used when generating the config, are located in the code directly above the value definition (`#[default ... ]`).

## Config Options

- **version:**_[number]_ The version of the config file. When loading the config this is value checked to migrate the file if needed.
- **windows:**_[Windows?]_ Configuration for the different windows like overview, switch and launcher (optional).

## Windows

- **scale:**_[number]_ The scale used to scale down the real dimension the windows displayed in the overview. Can be set from `0.0 < X > to 15.0`

  Pressing arrow up or down switches between the rows.
- **overview:**_[Overview?]_ Configuration for the overview mode (optional).
- **switch:**_[Switch?]_ Configuration for the switch mode (optional).

- **launcher:**_[Launcher]_ Configuration for the launcher.
- **key:**_[string]_ The key to use to open the Overview mode (like "tab" or "alt_r"). This is used to register the keybinding to open the Overview mode. If you want to only open using a modifier, set this to the modifier name like `super_l`.

    - **current_monitor**: Only includes windows of the current monitor.
- **hide_filtered:**_[boolean]_ !deprecated! whether to hide the filtered windows or not. This is used to show the windows that are filtered out by the `filter_by` option. If this is set to false, the filtered windows are shown with a grayscale effect.

## Launcher

- **default_terminal:**_[string]_ Defined the name of the default terminal to use. This value is optional, if unset a list of [default terminals](../crates/core-lib/src/const.rs) is used to find a default terminal.
  This is used to launch programs like micro from the launcher that need to be run in a terminal.
  This terminal is also used by the `terminal` plugin to run the typed command in a terminal.

- **max_items:**_[number]_ Sets the maximum number of items to show in the launcher.
  This does not include the plugin row and only limits the number of items retuned by for examples the application search.
  This value will get reduced to 10 if it is set to a value higher than 10.
- **show_when_empty:**_[boolean]_ Show entries in the launcher when no text is entered.
- **plugins:**_[Plugins]_ Configuration for each Plugin. Ignore the individual plugins to disable them.

### Plugins

- **applications:** Show installed applications in the launcher, filed by the input, sorted by how often they are used. The following options can be provided:

# CSS

The CSS file is located at `~/.config/hyprshell/styles.css` but can be configured using the `-s` argument.
The config is loaded at startup and is reloaded when the file changes. (removing styles will not work, adding or overriding styles works)

**Some examples can be found in the [CSS Examples folder](css-examples).**

To generate a default file with all possible classes and CSS variables, run the following command:

```bash
hyprshell config generate
```

GTK only supports a subset of CSS, so not all CSS properties will work. The supported properties are listed in the [GTK documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/css-overview.html).

The override file contains many empty classes that can be used to configure padding, fonts, etc.
These settings will take priority over the default values set by the application itself. The application defaults can be found in the CSS files inside the codebase (for example, [this one](../src/default_styles.css) or [that one](../crates/windows-lib/src/styles.css)).

If you want to change colors borders, etc. you can edit the CSS variables in the `:root {}` section.
These styles are automatically used everywhere in the application, so you don't have to set them for every class.
The values in the `:root {}` are set as fallbacks everywhere in the application, so you can just not set the ones you don't want to change.
